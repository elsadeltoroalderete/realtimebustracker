# REAL TIME BUS TRACKER PROJECT

## What's this project about?
With this project is about creating a real time bus tracker, fetching live information from public APIs and using maps already styled from reknowed maps services such as google maps. Also this is a useful exercise to learn how to use keys, servers and programms that already exist. This is a dynamic activity that gets advantage of the skills mostly in JavaScript, but still linked HTML and CSS.

## How to Run: 
- Get sure you download three files:
   ·  index.html
   ·  mapanimation.js
   ·  style.css
   ·  blue.png
   ·  marker.png
   ·  red.png
- The javascript and css files are already inserted in the html file, and the two files plus the three images must be saved in the same directory, always check it is done like this.
- Load "index.html" file in the web browser.
- Instantly you'll see the points that locate live bus positions, and keep looking, so you encounter every 3 seconds how the bus location has changed.
  
## What's next?
With these kind of projects that fetch to live information, one can always try to refactor it, by using data from other public APIs or by adapting the styling, and some much more dynamic options to refactor.
